  - lack of indentation and single character variables were used to save screen space.  Assignements were created on a 7" laptop.
  - syntax is horrible - use indentation for better readabilty
  - use better variable names - although single character variables save on bytes.  It is very difficult to understand what certain variables are.
  - Comment - Put the assignment in the program.  Looking at the program 8 years later, it is difficult to understand the purpose of the program.  Documentation is vital!
